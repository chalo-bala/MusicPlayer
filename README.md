# MusicPlayer-MVI
An example app to showcase the MVI pattern using Kotlin Flows and JetpackCompose. The history of this repo has earlier versions that used RxJava and xml layouts instead.
WIP - fix broken tests.
The pattern used is very similar to the one detailed in this YouTube video by Kaushik Gopal - https://youtu.be/BdGVCsHj2vU
